## 1. Agent Communication Pattern 🟢

**Question:** How do agents share context with each other?

**Sub-questions:**
- Does each agent see the full conversation history or just relevant parts?
- How does the Evaluator get access to what Brainstormer produced?
- Do agents pass messages directly or through a shared state?

**Options:**
- A) Full conversation history shared with all agents
- B) Filtered/relevant context per agent role
- C) Explicit message passing between agents
- D) Shared state object that agents read/write to

**Decision:** **Hybrid: Shared State Object (D) + Filtered Context (B)**

**Implementation:**
```python
# Structured state for data
class SessionState(BaseModel):
    user_request: str
    plan: Optional[Plan] = None
    research_findings: List[Finding] = []
    generated_prompts: List[Prompt] = []
    evaluations: List[Evaluation] = []
    iteration: int = 0

# Each agent gets filtered conversation history
planner_context = [user_message]
researcher_context = [user_message, planner_response]
brainstormer_context = [user_message, research_summary]  # NOT full research process
evaluator_context = [user_message, generated_prompts]    # NOT brainstorming process
```

**Rationale:**
- **Structured data in shared state** - Easy to checkpoint, resume, and access specific outputs
- **Filtered conversation history** - Reduces token costs and prevents irrelevant context from distracting agents
- **Prevents bias** - Evaluator doesn't see Brainstormer's reasoning process, ensures objective scoring
- **Type-safe** - Pydantic models provide validation and clear schema
- **Efficient** - Only pass relevant context to each agent's LLM calls
- **Flexible** - Can adjust filtering strategy per agent as needed
- **Framework-friendly** - Works well with MS Agent Framework's state management

---

## 2. Scoring System Details 🟢

**Question:** How should solutions be scored?

**Sub-questions:**
- What's the scale? (1-10, 0-100, letter grades?)
- What criteria does the Evaluator use?
- Single score or multiple dimensions (creativity, feasibility, completeness)?
- Is scoring deterministic or LLM-based?

**Options:**
- A) Simple 1-10 single score (LLM-based)
- B) Multi-dimensional scoring (creativity: X, feasibility: Y, clarity: Z)
- C) Hybrid: LLM generates score + human can override
- D) Comparative ranking instead of absolute scores

**Decision:** **Multi-dimensional Scoring (B) with Human Override (C)**

**Implementation:**
```python
class Evaluation(BaseModel):
    prompt_id: str
    quality: float        # 0-10: General goodness
    clarity: float        # 0-10: Easy to understand/use
    specificity: float    # 0-10: Detailed enough
    overall: float        # Average of dimensions
    reasoning: str        # Explanation for each score
    human_override: Optional[float] = None  # User can override overall score

    @property
    def final_score(self) -> float:
        return self.human_override if self.human_override else self.overall

# Usage:
# Autonomous mode: Uses overall score, terminates at >= 9.0
# Interactive mode: User can override any score
```

**Scoring Dimensions (MVP):**
- **Quality** - General excellence, fit for purpose
- **Clarity** - Easy to understand and actionable
- **Specificity** - Sufficient detail and precision
- **Overall** - Average of the three dimensions

**Human Override:**
- In **interactive mode**: User can override any evaluation after seeing it
- In **autonomous mode**: Override disabled, uses LLM scores
- Overrides are saved for future learning (Phase 4 enhancement)

**Rationale:**
- **Multi-dimensional feedback** - Agents know exactly what to improve
- **Transparency** - User understands WHY a score was given
- **Iterative improvement** - Brainstormer can target weak dimensions
- **Human-in-the-loop** - User maintains control when desired
- **Flexible** - Can add use-case specific dimensions later
- **Data-rich** - Better for cost/benefit analysis and analytics
- **Autonomous-friendly** - Works without human when needed

## 3. CLI Commands & Interface 🟢

**Question:** What commands and interface will users interact with?

**Sub-questions:**
- What top-level commands? (e.g., `start`, `resume`, `list`, `export`)
- How are agent thoughts displayed during execution?
- Real-time streaming output or batch display after each step?
- How to show multiple agents working in parallel?

**Options:**
- A) Simple commands: `ideation start`, `ideation resume <session-id>`
- B) Rich subcommands: `ideation session new`, `ideation session resume`
- C) Interactive mode: Launch into interactive shell
- D) Combination: Support both CLI commands and interactive mode

**Decision:** **Interactive Shell Mode (C) - No CLI commands needed for MVP**

**Agent Pool Architecture:**
- **1 Planner** - Creates execution plan
- **1 Expert** - Clarifies requirements (conditional)
- **Multiple Researchers** (2-3) - Parallel research on different aspects
- **Multiple Brainstormers** (2-3) - Generate diverse solutions
- **1 Evaluator** - Scores all outputs

**Interface Design:**

## 14. Dynamic Agent Configuration & Optimization 🔴

**Question:** Should the system automatically optimize agent count, types, and execution strategy?

**Sub-questions:**
- How to determine optimal number of researchers and brainstormers?
- Should agent specializations be dynamic (AI-generated) or predefined?
- How to decide turn-taking strategy (sequential, parallel, hybrid)?
- Should configuration adapt based on use case or past performance?

**Options:**

### A) Hardcoded Configuration (Simple)
```python
# Fixed configuration per use case
IMAGE_PROMPTS_CONFIG = {
    "researchers": 3,  # trends, materials, composition
    "brainstormers": 3,  # minimal, detailed, atmospheric
    "parallel": True
}
```
**Pros:**
- ✅ Simple, predictable
- ✅ Fast to implement
- ✅ Easy to debug

**Cons:**
- ❌ Not adaptive
- ❌ May be suboptimal for some cases

---

### B) Meta-Agent (AI Designs the Team)
```python
# Meta-planner decides configuration
[Meta-Planner] Analyzing task: "Generate architecture prompts"
  → Need 3 researchers: trends, materials, lighting
  → Need 2 brainstormers: minimalist, maximalist
  → Strategy: Parallel research, sequential brainstorming
```
**Pros:**
- ✅ Adaptive to task complexity
- ✅ Can discover novel configurations
- ✅ Uses LLM reasoning

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Extra LLM call (cost + latency)
- ⚠️ Less predictable

---

### C) Rule-Based Optimizer
```python
# Rules based on task characteristics
if task_complexity == "high":
    researchers = 4
elif task_complexity == "medium":
    researchers = 3
else:
    researchers = 2

if need_diversity:
    brainstormers = 3
    parallel = True
```
**Pros:**
- ✅ Deterministic
- ✅ No extra LLM calls
- ✅ Can encode domain knowledge

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Requires manual rule tuning
- ⚠️ May miss edge cases

---

### D) Learning-Based (Phase 4 Enhancement)
```python
# Learn from past sessions what works best
# Store: (task_type, config, quality_score, cost, time)
# Use historical data to predict optimal config

Past data:
  architecture_prompts + 3 researchers + 2 brainstormers → 8.5/10, $0.40, 5min
  architecture_prompts + 2 researchers + 3 brainstormers → 7.0/10, $0.35, 4min

→ Next time: Use 3 researchers + 2 brainstormers
```
**Pros:**
- ✅ Improves over time
- ✅ Data-driven optimization
- ✅ Cost-effective

**Cons:**
- ❌ Requires historical data
- ❌ Complex implementation
- ❌ Phase 4 feature

---

### E) Hybrid: Meta-Agent + User Override
```python
# Meta-agent proposes configuration
[Meta-Planner] Proposed team:
  - 3 Researchers (trends, materials, composition)
  - 2 Brainstormers (minimal, detailed)
  - Parallel execution

Approve? (y/n/edit)
User: edit → "Add one more brainstormer for atmospheric variation"

[Meta-Planner] Updated team:
  - 3 Researchers
  - 3 Brainstormers (minimal, detailed, atmospheric)
```
**Pros:**
- ✅ Adaptive + user control
- ✅ Best of both worlds
- ✅ Educational for user

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Requires user input
- ⚠️ Slower than autonomous

---

**Turn-Taking Strategies:**

1. **Full Parallel** - All researchers run simultaneously, all brainstormers run simultaneously
   - Fastest, highest diversity, highest cost

2. **Sequential** - One agent at a time
   - Slowest, most observable, cheapest

3. **Batched Parallel** - Researchers in parallel, then brainstormers in parallel
   - Balanced speed and cost

4. **Dynamic** - Meta-agent decides based on task
   - Most flexible, requires AI orchestration

---

**Decision:** [To be decided]

**Rationale:** [To be filled]

**Recommendation for MVP:**
- Start with **Option B (Meta-Agent)** for configuration
- Use **Batched Parallel** execution (research together, brainstorm together)
- Allow user to see and approve the proposed team
- Add learning-based optimization in Phase 4

**Example Flow:**
```
